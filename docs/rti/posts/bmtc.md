    > One of our major initiatives is the implementation of the National
    > Common Mobility Card (NCMC). We envision moving beyond even the need for physical
    > cards. Almost everyone carries a mobile phone, so we aim to facilitate mobile-based
    > payments. We aim to eliminate the need for any physical cards, allowing people to walk in
    > and out of transport systems seamlessly. Similar to how FASTag works at toll plazas, GPS-
    > based ticketing systems automatically calculate fares based on where passengers board and
    > alight from the bus, deducting the fare from their account without human intervention.

/// details |:material-calendar: 01/07/2025 Appeal Hearing Summary

Participants:

- First Appellate authority, the Chief System Manager (CSM): Mr. Sadananda K G,
- System Manager (SM): Raghavendra Kumar M J,
- Deputy System Manager (DSM): Smt Priyanka A,
- Assistant Mechanical Engineer (AME): Mr Ananda M B (the PIO)
- An officer for transcription of the proceedings: Smt unknown.

Paraphrasing of the conversation:

- CSM: Why do you want the source code?
- Me: There are many issues which the developers in Bengaluru can fix and improve the app.
- CSM: We don't want anybody else to improve the app. We will carry this app project for 3-4 years as long as the contract is valid. That will be a big enough achievement for us. We are not looking for anything more than that.
- Me: .....
- CSM: Further, releasing the code can cause user privacy issues.
- Me: Open source doesn't cause that.
- CSM: Releasing the [app] source code can cause issues in the server where the service is hosted in the central Karnataka server.
- Me: Client code is different and doesn't affect the server. Many good and secure things are open source already like the Android, Chrome, Firefox that you're using. You can even monetize it by licensing it to other bus corporations in the country.
- CSM: This is our property. [smiles] Why should we share or give it away or sell it? We don't want to do it.
- Me: So it's a willpower issue?
- CSM: [leans back] No no.. it's not a willpower issue.
- AME: The app is under a contract basis with a third party and we will not have the code for the next 3-4 years. Only after the contract expires will we get the code and the knowledge transfer.
- Transcriptionist: Why don't you build a different and a better app ? Why do you need our source code?
- Me: A teenager tried in 2019 and you blocked his app by taking the APIs private, and asked him to be a bidder in the tender and take on the entire app responsibility.

- AME: yes yes I remember this story. He had probably hacked our system. Because he was a kid, we only called him and his father to this office and did not take any legal action against him.
- DSM [comes in and gets the context]: [chitchat]
- CSM: This is our DSM. She's the technical person. I am a non-technical system manager.
- DSM: So do you want to contribute and participate in the development of this app?
- Me: If it were open source, I would do it for free.
- DSM: There is a contract with the vendor which doesn't have any such exit clause. If we had the code, we would **definitely** have done it.
- Me: Understood.
- Me to transcriptionist: Please reject the appeal under RTI section 8 1 d.

/// admonition | :material-calendar: 01/07/2025:
