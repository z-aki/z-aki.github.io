# Vulnerability Analysis and disclosures

CERT-in has been very responsive and helpful in reacting to incident reports and getting vulnerabilities fixed.

- Report incidents to [CERT-in](https://www.cert-in.org.in/RVDCP.jsp) using the form given on that page. The PDF is just a guide. An email is sufficient as long as it contains all the fields of that PDF form.
- For finance related vulnerabilities, CC this email: [CSIRT-fin](https://www.cert-in.org.in/PDF/CSIRT-Fin.pdf)

All of the vulnerabilities presented here are for educational purpose (especially for the CISO and developers of these organizations). All vulnerabilities have been fixed by the service providers before these disclosures.
