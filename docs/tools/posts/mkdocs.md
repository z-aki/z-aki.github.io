[Open external links and internal files (pdf etc.,) in new tabs. Customizable with icon using CSS](https://github.com/z-aki/mkdocs-plugin-open-external-links-in-new-tab)

This plugin allows you to open external links in a new tab. Adds `target="_blank"` and `"rel"="noopener noreferrer"` to any link that is not from 127.0.0.1 or `site_url` config.

Certain file extensions (.pdf etc.) to be opened a new tab can also be customized.

The CSS icon before/after the link can also be customized.
